Hi Fellow Programers!

I am writing to you from the planet Org; 
It is alien langauage for Mars;

Hahahah...I'm just messing with you guys.
My name is Tolu Oyeniyi and I am a Junior studying Computer Applications at the University of Maine at Fort Kent (UMFK).
As you can tell, I love programming (did you notice my semicolons above), so far I am fluent in HTML, CSS, javaScript, PHP, and I
am in the middle of learning Java and C++.

My favorite sport is soccer, and I love watching superhero movies or series, animal documentaries, cooking shows, and anything action.

I'm glad to have been able to talk to you.

OrgaHanoTs, till next time.

Tolu is a great student.
